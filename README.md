# Census Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a project analyzing a mock census dataset for a small UK town. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for local government decisions on urban planning and resource allocation.

## Project Description

The project involves:
- Cleaning and analyzing census data (`census_data.csv`).
- Addressing missing entries and identifying patterns like population growth, unemployment trends, housing needs, and religious affiliations.
- Using the analysis to propose urban planning decisions and investment priorities.

## Tasks
1. **Urban Planning**: Decide what to build on an unoccupied plot of land:
   - High/Low-density housing.
   - Train station.
   - Religious building.
   - Emergency medical center.
   - Alternative options.
2. **Investment Priorities**:
   - Employment and training.
   - Old age care.
   - Increased schooling spending.
   - General infrastructure.

## Files in Repository
- `FDS_mock_census.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, analysis, and recommendations.
- `census_data.csv`: The mock census dataset.
- `Task Description.docx`: Detailed project background and requirements.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

## How to Run
1. Open `FDS_mock_census.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure dependencies are installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy`).
3. Follow the notebook cells to clean, analyze, and visualize the census data.

## Acknowledgments
